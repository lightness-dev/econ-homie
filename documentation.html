        <h2>6. Referral System</h2>
        <p>Refer your friends to Econ Homie using the <code>$refer</code> command and earn escalating rewards for each successful referral! With this command, you refer someone by providing them with your Discord ID. They can then claim the referral by using the <code>$refer</code> command followed by your Discord ID (for example, <code>$refer &lt;Your_Discord_ID&gt;</code>). The new referral system has several features and requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> The new referral system works on a tiered reward basis. The more friends you refer, the higher your reward will be! The bonus Dollaridoos for each referral increase according to the following tiers: 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1200. For example, if you refer 1 friend, you get 100 Dollaridoos; for 2 friends referred, you get 150 Dollaridoos each, and so on. Once you've reached 8 referrals and above, you will get 1200 Dollaridoos for each referral.</li>
            <li><strong>Referral bonus for the referred friend:</strong> The referred friend will always receive a bonus of 250 Dollaridoos.</li>
            <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> To refer someone, you need to have an Econ Homie account and have been a member of Discord for at least sixty days. Note that you can only be referred once.</li>
            <li><strong>Referral data:</strong> You can check your referral data, such as who referred you, how many users you have referred, how much you have earned from referrals, and how much you will earn from the next referral.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that you can't refer yourself and your referred friend should not have already been referred by someone else. Also, the Discord account of the referred friend should be at least sixty days old. If you don't have an Econ Homie account yet, use the <code>$createaccount</code> command to create one.</p>
        <p>Once a referral is successful, you and your referred friend will be notified, and the referral bonus will be added to your accounts. The system will also update your referral status for future reference.</p>
